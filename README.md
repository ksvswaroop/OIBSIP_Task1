IRIS Classifier Model

Understand the problem statement

As a Data Scientist,We all of us have the indepth knowledge of Iris Dataset.The Data Set contains 3 classes of 50 instances of each,where each class refers to species of iris flower.The main objective of the problem statement is to build a classifier model by using advance data science techniques.Here I am trying play with different algorithms and its parameters to maximize the accuracy of model.

Attribute Information:

Id----> Id represents each record uniquely(int)

SepalLengthCm---->Sepal lenght in centimeter(float)

SepalWidthCm---->Sepal Width in centimeter(float)

PetalLengthCm---->Peatal lenght in cm(float)

PetalWidthCm---->Petal width in cm(float)

Species----> Types of species of iris flower like setosa,versicolor,verginica(object)
